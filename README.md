# 65536
A fork of [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) which is a small clone of [1024](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veewo.a1024), based on [Saming's 2048](http://saming.fr/p/2048/) (also a clone).

Unlike 2048, numbers are multiplied together. Have fun!

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://matthewbauer.github.io/65536/)
